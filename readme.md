# 🪱 [Bookworm](https://ryanlaycock.itch.io/bookworm)
A game I made (with Abby's help on the book artwork🤎), for Mini Jam 141: Stories².
This was my first game jam, and first game I've "finished"! Hopefully I'll find some time to add more levels in the near future.

## ❓ About the Game

A sidescroller/platformer where you take on the roll of a bookworm, trying to escape the smash of the librarian's fly swatter. On your way across the shelves however, you'll encounter the worst of all enemies - the dreaded MOTH! 



Not scary? Oh, wait until you see how ridiculously overpowered they are - don't even try!

As a bookworm, its only natural you'll need to dive into books to give yourself strength (and a perfect hiding spot!), but eat read too many words and you might just overpower yourself too...
